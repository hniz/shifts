        investing in, the idea of shifts is to provide a community where
        like-minded investors can chat about a certain stock. The list
        of featured stocks will be updated on a daily basis through
        web scraping various news outlets and online communities to
        get the top mentioned stock tickers. Other stock tickersâ€™ 
chat rooms will be available through a search functionality.</p>
